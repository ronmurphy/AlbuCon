# PWA Icons Needed

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add app icons to the `public` folder:

## Required Icons:

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192px)
   - Used for Android app icon and splash screen
   - Should be placed in `/public/icon-192.png`

2. **icon-512.png** (512x512px)
   - Used for high-resolution displays
   - Should be placed in `/public/icon-512.png`

## Icon Requirements:

- **Format:** PNG with transparent background (or solid color)
- **Design:** Simple, recognizable logo/icon for AlbuCon
- **Content:** Should work well at small sizes
- **Style:** Match your brand colors (current theme: #667eea)

## Quick Icon Creation Options:

1. **Use an existing logo:** If you have a logo, resize it to 512x512 and 192x192
2. **Create with design tools:** Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
3. **Use an icon generator:** Try https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

## Temporary Solution:

You can use your current favicon/vite.svg as a temporary icon by converting it to PNG format at the required sizes.

## After Adding Icons:

The PWA will automatically use these icons when users install the app to their home screen.
